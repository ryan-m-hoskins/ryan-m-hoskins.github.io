# Welcome to my CS499 Computer Science Capstone Portfolio!

Hello, I'm Ryan! I'm a Computer Science student with an Associate in Engineering degree and will soon have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. This portfolio demonstrates the various soft skills, hard skills, and technical skills that I have developed over the course of the last four years, as shown in my capstone project. 

## Capstone Project: Weight Tracking Application

My capstone project focused on revisting a previous project I completed and critically reviewing it, identifying issues and potential improvements, and implementing three key enhancements - each of a specific category. This project demonstrates a proficiency for:
- Mobile application development in Android Studio
- Kotlin and Java programming
- Database implementation with Room and Firebase
- UI and UX Design
- Data visualization
- Software and system architecture

### About This Portfolio

This portfolio will provide a full walkthrough of the capstone project. In this, I will be covering:
- A thorough self-assessment of my experience in the Computer Science program
- Performing a code review of the mobile application's original code
- Providing an overview of the capstone project
- Diving into each of the three enhancements implemented to the project
