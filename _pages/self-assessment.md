# Professional Self-Assessment

## Introduction

Hello! 

My name is Ryan Hoskins and I am a passionate and dedicated Software Developer that has spent the last four years obtaining an Associate in Science, Associate in Engineering, and Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science degree in Computer Science with a concentration on Software Engineering. Throughout my academic pursuits, I have continued to work full-time as a Product Support Expert for one of the largest Media Monitoring and Media Intelligence companies, where I collaborate across teams and assisted Engineers in day-to-day processes. Over the course of the Computer Science program, I have been exposed to a variety of technologies and principles ranging from Full-stack Development, software reverse engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as mobile application development. I have also had the chance to hone my skills and expertise in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and database management. This portfolio is meant to demonstrate my growth over the course of this program and address several key course outcomes from the Computer Science Capstone course.
